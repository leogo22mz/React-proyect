## About The Project


Honestly I was thinking in how viral can become some recipes in social media like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or event TikTok, then I wonder if there was a place where everyone from around the world can share their recipes to the world!!
That is how ECFood was born, cooking is literally necessary for everyone: No matter if you are a student in search of cheap-easy recipes, a cooking investigator who wants to discover new flavours, or maybe you just want to try the food from another country. You all can use ECFood to get learn new recipes and surprise your relatives.
